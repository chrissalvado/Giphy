created by: Chris Salvado @Csalv-chris

The Giphy poject makes use of the giphy API, it consists of a series of buttons across a number of sports .When clicked ten images from that sport will appear in static form down a row, if you click on the image it will then show the animated gif. There is also a button which allows you to add a sport of your choosing. Have fun !
